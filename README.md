# Recurring - An [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) Extension
We will use as a layer to organise fiat subscriptions for our saas. 
Later however it will be generalised and used for managing payments for an ongoing service of something, paid for with:
* payg sats
* payg fiat
* lnurlw subscription
* fiat subscription
  
Also have it optionally email/nostr dm users when funds need topping up.
